# bataille-de-jedis
<h2> Description </h2>
This Java script web app is a jedis battle simulation. <br>
Inspired by https://github.com/mzellner0 user. <br>
Full course available here : https://www.udemy.com/course/creer-un-jeu-3d-sur-le-web-a-laide-de-threejs/ (in French) <br>

<h2> Why this web app exists ? </h2>
<p>This web application is a full review of all the fundemantals of Javascript Vanilla from basics to more advanced JS frameworks such as three.js. <br>
This a good overall taste of how JS works, using object-oriented logic going from 0 to 100. I hardly recommand this project for someone that knows JS basics and want to dive deeper into this language.
